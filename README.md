# Hand Gesture Recognition using Furhat Robot

Project consist of three subsystem. Landmark extraction to get the annotations for the video, 
Gesture recognition to predict the gesture from the annotations, 
Responsive behaviour which responds to the gesture, and focused on End-to-End Learning.
Machine learning and FurhatSDK are used in the design and methodology as required by the subsystems.
